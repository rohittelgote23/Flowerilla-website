			<p>What is the importance of flowers in our life? Flowers not only add color, texture, and biodiversity to gardens and environments, they are also an important structure for plants and an essential food source for many organisms. Flowers are an important means of attracting pollen substances to plants, and plants need to produce seeds, the reproductive structures that allow seeds to exist for generations. Flowers can also protect growing seeds and successfully pass genetic material to the next generation. Flowering plants are called angiosperms and are a group that has evolved to include a variety of sizes, shapes, and colours.</p>
